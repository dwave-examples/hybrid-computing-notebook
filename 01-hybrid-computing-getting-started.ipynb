    "Quantum-classical hybrid is the use of both classical and quantum resources to solve problems, exploiting the complementary strengths that each provides.

    "[*dwave-hybrid*](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/hybrid) provides you with a Python framework for building a variety of flexible hybrid workflows. These use quantum and classical resources together to find good solutions to your problem. For example, a hybrid workflow might use classical resources to find a problem’s hard core and send that to the quantum processing unit (QPU), or break a large problem into smaller pieces that can be solved on a QPU and then recombined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *dwave-hybrid* framework enables rapid development of experimental prototypes, which provide insight into expected performance of the productized versions. It provides reference samplers and workflows you can quickly plug into your application code. You can easily experiment with customizing workflows that best solve your problem. You can also develop your own hybrid components to optimize performance.  "
