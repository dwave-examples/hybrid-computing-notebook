These solvers, which implement state-of-the-art classical algorithms together with intelligent allocation of the quantum processing unit (QPU) to parts of the problem where it benefits most, are designed to accommodate even very large problems. Leap's solvers can relieve you of the burden of any current and future development and optimization of hybrid algorithms that best solve your problem. \n",

    "[*dwave-hybrid*](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_hybrid/sdk_index.html) provides you with a Python framework for building a variety of flexible hybrid workflows. These use quantum and classical resources together to find good solutions to your problem. For example, a hybrid workflow might use classical resources to find a problemâ€™s hard core and send that to the QPU, or break a large problem into smaller pieces that can be solved on a QPU and then recombined.\n",
